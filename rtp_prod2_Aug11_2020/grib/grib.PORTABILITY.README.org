For portability, this structure either needs to be replicated on host
machines or these paths need to be made configurable.

* Required addpaths
Functions fill_ecmwf, fill_era, and fill_merra require routines found
on the UMBC cluster system at
   - /asl/matlib/aslutil
   - /asl/packages/time

* staticly defined directories
Each function also looks for a static directory where it's input data
files can be found. On the UMBC system, these directories are:
     - /asl/data/ecmwf
     - /asl/data/era
     - /asl/data/merra
