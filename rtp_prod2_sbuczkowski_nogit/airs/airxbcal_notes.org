Input:

cell array airxbcal{} with names of variables needed

cell array rtpname{} with names that map to the above

Can't use udefs for the above, do them separately


for i=1:length(airxbcal}

  prof.rtpname{i} = hdfsw('readfield',swath_id,airxbcal{i},[],[],[])

%  [junk, s] = hdfsw('readfield',swath_id, fstr, [],[],[]);
end


I don't know why they are using hdfsw, how about just

hdfread(fn,varname)?

airxbcal = {'avnsst','junk'}

for i=1:length(airxbcal)
  p.(rtpname{i}) = hdfread(fn,airxbcal{i})
end



p.('sst') = hdfread(fn,k{1});

works great!

for udefs
   
   udefi = [1,2,3,5,10];
   airxbcal_udef = {'cxq2','xxx','whatever'}   
   
for i=1:length(udefi)
   p.udef(udefi(i),:) = hdfread(fn,airxbcal_udef{i});
end

airxbcal{} cell array of names (hardcoded rtp prof.xxx)
airxbcal_udef{} cell array of udef names (go into prof.udef(x,:))

rtpname{} rtp names to go one-to-one with airxbcal{} names
udefi = [1,2,3,...]  udef indices that go with rtpname{}
         
looks like the two vis indicators come in 2 sets of 3, will
         have to do special case for those, just code by hand
