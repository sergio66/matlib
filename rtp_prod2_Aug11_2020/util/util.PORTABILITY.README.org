* rtpadd_usgs_10dem
needs path to source data file but is configurable. Default is UMBC
local path /asl/data/usgs/world_grid_deg10_v2.mat

Optional calling paramter 'root' can be set as a directory path to
replace the '/asl/' root or can be set as a full path to a replacement
DEM file.

* hha_lat_subsample_equal_area3
Requires two paths
- /asl/matlib/rtptools
- /asl/packages/ccast/motmsc/time (can this be replaced by
  /asl/packages/time or do we need to rip more isolated functions out
  of ccast?)
